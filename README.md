# TALESOFMURDER-UI

Manages all components, reusable styles, branding, remix componets, etc. Packaged as its own private npm package and imported into other repos as needed. Currently (as of 06.12.24) part of the monorepo branch on cc_nos as styles in the storefront. 

The styles (tailwind), reusable components, etc. will be extracted into their own repo. For now, to get things up and running, they may just be duplicated (copy/paste) across repos; this (may) allow(s) me to get a functional website and store going now.
